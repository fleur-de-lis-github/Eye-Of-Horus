## Problem Scenario
Despite substantial advances in global human well-being, the world continues to experience humanitarian crisis and natural disasters. Long-term and reignited conflicts affect people in many parts of the world, but often, accurate maps of the affected regions either do not exist or are outdated by disaster or conflict. Translating satellite imagery into maps requires intensive effort and time, especially leading to inaccurate maps of the affected regions during disaster and conflict.

## Data Summary  

The data was taken from Kaggle and it contains around 25k images of Natural Scenes around the world. All training and testing images with a size of 150x150
are classified into 6 categories:
• buildings = 0
• forest = 1
• glacier = 2
• mountains = 3
• sea = 4
• street = 5
The data consists of 3 separated datasets:
• Train with 14034 images
• Test with 3000 images
• Prediction with 7301 images
This data was originally published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel for the Image Classification Competition.
